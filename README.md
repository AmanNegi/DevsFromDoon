## ðŸš¨ Problem Statement

The current event management at the university is inefficient and manually intensive. The key issues include:

1. Announcements need to be manually made, leading to delays and missed communications.
2. Event organizers collect participant details manually using Google Forms, which is not streamlined.
3. WhatsApp groups are manually created and managed for event-related notifications.
4. The UI of the UMS for such announcements is unnecessarily coupled, making it hard to find event-related updates.
5. Payments for any paid events are handled manually, where users must attach screenshots, causing difficulties in verifying payments and tracking transactions.
6. Event check-ins are managed manually, leading to long wait times and errors in attendance tracking.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Statement

To address these issues, the event management app would:

1. **Automate Announcements:** Implement a centralized system to automatically notify users about event updates and reminders via push notifications.
2. **Integrated Data Collection:** Use in-app registration to simplify participant data collection and eliminate the need for Google Forms.
3. **Automated Notifications:** Automate in-app notifications, ensuring efficient and timely communication.
4. **Streamlined UI/UX:** Decouple the UMS UI from event management, offering a cleaner and more intuitive interface.
5. **Integrated Payment Gateway:** Incorporate a built-in payment system that verifies transactions automatically, removing the need for screenshot uploads.
6. **QR Code Check-ins:** Introduce QR code check-ins to enable faster and more efficient event entry, reducing errors and wait times.
