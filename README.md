# 🎉 LPU Events App

A platform that helps organizers to organize events in LPU efficiently. Currently organizers have to manually visit classes to inform about their event, also the announcement in LPU does not provide a useful addition to this. Organizers also have to go through the burden to float Google Forms and then create Whats App Groups, which is a long and tiring process. Our app aims to solve this issue by providing a platform which streamlines the entire process from creating events, accepting data from people, accepting payments and creating groups.

## ⏳ App Flow 

1. Organizer creates an event, and asks for required information.
2. People register in the event, and provide the detail directly from the platform.
3. If it's a paid event people can directly pay from our platform.
4. A group is created automatically of all the members.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

The current event management at the university is inefficient and manually intensive. The key issues include:

1. Announcements need to be manually made, leading to delays and missed communications.
2. Event organizers collect participant details manually using Google Forms, which is not streamlined.
3. WhatsApp groups are manually created and managed for event-related notifications.
4. The UI of the UMS for such announcements is unnecessarily coupled, making it hard to find event-related updates.
5. Payments for any paid events are handled manually, where users must attach screenshots, causing difficulties in verifying payments and tracking transactions.
6. Event check-ins are managed manually, leading to long wait times and errors in attendance tracking.

## 💡 Solution Statement

To address these issues, the event management app would:

1. **Automate Announcements:** Implement a centralized system to automatically notify users about event updates and reminders via push notifications.
2. **Integrated Data Collection:** Use in-app registration to simplify participant data collection and eliminate the need for Google Forms.
3. **Automated Notifications:** Automate in-app notifications, ensuring efficient and timely communication.
4. **Streamlined UI/UX:** Decouple the UMS UI from event management, offering a cleaner and more intuitive interface.
5. **Integrated Payment Gateway:** Incorporate a built-in payment system that verifies transactions automatically, removing the need for screenshot uploads.
6. **QR Code Check-ins:** Introduce QR code check-ins to enable faster and more efficient event entry, reducing errors and wait times.
